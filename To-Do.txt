This is a To-Do list and rough outline on how I currently envision the project to be built.
I think it's redundant to explain that this is a Work in Progress and will be adjusted in the future.

What I need:
1. Texture struct that holds mlx_texture_t* for each of the walls, the floor, doors, the skybox, the exit and maybe some gatherables.
2. map parsing / validation
3. Player positioning
4. angle calculation of perspective
5. image rendering / updating based on these calculations
6. keyhooks for movement presses etc..
7. exit validation on exit key pickup together with changed animation state of exit gate/ doors.
8. and more...
